Finity UI is an open-source project maintained by [Finity UI team](https://github.com/finity-ui). We appreciate your interest and efforts to contribute to Finity UI.

Anyone can be a contributor. Either you found a typo, or you have an awesome feature request you could implement, we encourage you to create a Merge Request.

All efforts to contribute are highly appreciated, we recommend you talk to a maintainer prior to spending a lot of time making a merge request that may not align with the project roadmap.

## Values

- **Be the change** - Don't wait for anything, if you want something ship it but make sure it is sustainable for the long term.
- **Pride in product** - We ask ourselves whether we will use the feature if it goes live before creating it.
- **Diversity** - We welcome differences, and listen before we speak. It proportionally leads to extraordinary results and experiences.
